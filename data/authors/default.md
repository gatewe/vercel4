I have always had this inner need to create a blog content. Can you count how many times good blog post saved you a lot of time while solving some problem? Me neither. Giving back to IT (security) community is important to me. And 
I can also benefit from this effort as writing will definitely help me to remember and to understand the content deeper. Remember when you were explaining math problem to your classmate before exam and suddenly you could remember the solution deeper? There are even studies about this: [The relative benefits of learning by teaching and teaching expectancy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361476X13000209/)
